# 🚀 Blockchain Solidity Projects

Welcome to the **Blockchain Solidity Projects** repository!  
This repo contains a series of beginner-to-intermediate smart contracts I built during a 4-day Blockchain workshop.  
Each contract demonstrates a core concept in Ethereum smart contract development.

## 🧩 Smart Contracts Overview

| Contract           | Description                                                                                           |
|--------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **HelloWorld.sol** | The simplest Solidity contract. Stores and retrieves a "Hello, World!" message.                      |
| **Counter.sol**    | Counter contract with `increment`, `decrement`, and `reset` functions. Shows state changes.          |
| **EventCounter.sol** | Extends Counter by adding **events**. Logs every increment, decrement, and reset on the blockchain.|
| **SimpleStorage.sol** | Stores and retrieves a single number. Demonstrates persistent blockchain storage.                 |
| **PausableToken.sol** | Basic token with **pause/unpause** ability. Shows modifiers, ownership, and restricted actions.   |
| **Twitter.sol**    | Mini Twitter-like contract: create tweet (max 280 chars), like/unlike, fetch tweets by ID/user.      |

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- **Solidity** `^0.8.0`
- **Remix IDE**
- **MetaMask** (for testnet deployment)

---

## 📌 Next Steps

- [ ] Build a simple frontend (React + Ethers.js) to interact with these contracts.
- [ ] Deploy contracts on a testnet (e.g., Goerli or Sepolia) for live testing.
- [ ] Add more advanced contracts such as ERC20/ERC721 tokens.
